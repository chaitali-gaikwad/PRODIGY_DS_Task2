# PRODIGY_DS_Task2
This code demonstrates the process of data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using pandas and matplotlib in Python. It loads a dataset from a CSV file, handles missing values, drops unnecessary columns, and then performs various visualizations to explore relationships and patterns in the data.

In summary, the code loads a dataset, cleans the data by filling missing values and dropping irrelevant columns, and conducts EDA through visualizations. It explores the survival rate overall and by different variables such as passenger class and gender. Additionally, it visualizes the age and fare distributions of the passengers.
